                           <strong>What personal information we collect</strong>
                           <ul>
                               <li>When you create an Orange Health, Inc.

                        </ul>


                        <strong>How we use your personal information</strong>
                            <p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Orange Health, Inc. is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Orange Health, Inc. or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. If you have questions about this legal basis you can contact Orange Health, Inc.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Orange Health, Inc.’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.</li>
                                <li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.</li>
                            <li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Orange Health, Inc. ID account holders.</li>
                                <li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Orange Health, Inc., you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <strong>Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you</strong>
                            <p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Orange Health, Inc. products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Orange Health, Inc. services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Orange Health, Inc. ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.</p>
                            <p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Orange Health, Inc., we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites. We will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.

For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.

                            <p>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</p>
                            <p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.

Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.</li>
                                <li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Cookies and Other Technologies</p>

These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
                                </p>

                                        It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Orange Health, Inc. to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.  This could include providing information to public or governmental authorities. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
                                </p>

                                <p>When you use some Orange Health, Inc. products, services, or applications or post on an Orange Health, Inc. forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>The Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling</p>
                                <p>Orange Health, Inc. does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.</p>
                                <strong>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</strong>
                                <p>Orange Health, Inc. makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.

                                <strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong>

                                <p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. We may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.</p>
